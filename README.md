# Capstone Project: Wildfires in California

## Project Goal
Even though the number of wildfires in the United States has slightly decreased over the last 30 years, the number of acres burnt has increased (Hoover & Hanson, 2019). Since 2000, every year “an average of 72,400 wildfires burned an average of 7.0 million acres” (Hoover & Hanson, 2019, p.1).  As recent examples of fires in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States illustrate, wildfires can have devastating consequences for both human and nature including loss of life, property, and natural habitat. While the size of a fire is not necessarily an indicator for its impact on human settlements or eco-systems (Hoover & Hanson, 2019), the increase in fire activity and fire size is a matter of concern. 
One of the hardest hit states in terms of wild fires is California. On average California experiences 2.821 fires burning about 70,719 acres per year (5-year average; Cal Fire, 2020). Fire activity is related to weather patterns and changing climates (Reinhardt, 2015). The relationships are complex as climate—e.g., dry climate—enhance fire risks while fires also have climatic implications (Merzdorf, 2019). The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of a fire to grow "big" in California. More specifically, we aim to develop machine learning models to predict fire size using weather data and data on fire characteristics.
